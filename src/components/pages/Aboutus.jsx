            The Department of Mathematics (today called, the Department of Mathematical and Computational Sciences) started along with the institute (1960). The Department of Mathematical and Computational Sciences, formerly known as Department of Mathematics, is one of the oldest departments of NITK. The department initially catered to the needs of the UG and PG Engineering Mathematics and subsequently, in 1988-89, introduced two PG programmes, namely, the <strong>Master of Computer Applications (MCA)</strong> and Master of Technology (M.Tech.) Computational Mathematics (CMA) (earlier named Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Systems Analysis and Computer Applications).
          </p>
          <p className="text-black text-lg mt-2 text-justify">
            The PG programme, Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Computational Mathematics (CMA) is replaced with <strong>Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Computational and Data Science (CDS)</strong> since 2019. A new UG programme, <strong>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Computational and Data Science (CDS)</strong> has commenced from the year 2022.

             MACS Department is known for its variety of courses in the areas of Algebra, Analysis, Applied Mathematics and Statistics. It not only caters to the needs of the other 13 departments of NITK but also offers its own masterâ€™s program in computer applications and computational mathematics. People from across the country come and enroll to the PhD program with faculties having expertise in the areas of Computational Systems, Nonlinear Analysis, Functional Analysis, Real Analysis, Number Theory & Cryptography, Numerical Analysis, Graph Theory, Optimization, Fluid Dynamics, Computer applications, Image  processing and many more. The strength of department lies in the blend of 31 (24 Full Time+ 7 on contract) faculty members in not only pure and applied areas of mathematics and statistics but also in the area of computer science (hence the name Computational Sciences) ably supported by 2 Technical Officers and 8 non-teaching staff.          </p>
          <p className="text-black text-lg mt-2 text-justify">
            A department can be assessed in terms of research and development by seeing number of Research Scholars / PhD students enrolled to the PhD program. Currently, 44 full-time research scholars and many part-time research scholars are working in frontier areas of mathematics, statistics and computer science. Furthermore, the department offers various elective courses to the requirement of other departments such as Number Theory & Cryptography, Probability Theory, Linear Algebra, Optimization Techniques, Random Processes, Computer Networks and such others.          </p>
      <p className="text-black text-lg mt-2 text-justify">
        Department of MACS was recognized as Study Centre for MCA and BCA Programmes of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) in 1999.
